Please help:

I implemented gRPC on the ConnectionService in the connection_api in controllers.py.  The service passes the message from the get endpoint to the backend database.  I was not able to figure out how to implement the endpoint in the React Front-End so it was hard to test that way.

I tried to test the endpoint using the grpc cli, however in order to do that I would need to enable reflection in the controller.py.  However, I tried many times to import and implement grpcio-reflection, but it refused to run correctly. There was no mention on how to test this in the course. I also tried grpc_curl but that also requires reflection to be enabled. 

How do implement reflection correctly in python? Is this what is intended by this section of the rubric?

Reference Error:
% grpc_cli ls localhost:5005
>>Received an error when querying services endpoint.
>>Reflection request not implemented; is the ServerReflection service enabled?
