Udaconnect Connection API using gRPC


I implemented gRPC on the ConnectionService in the connection_api defined in controllers.py.  The service passes the message from the gRPC endpoint to the backend database via `controllers.py` & `services.py`.

To access this endpoint from within the cluster from the deployed app you would use this ip : 10.43.255.199:5005 in the client.

To access the exposed endpoint from outside of Kubernetes hosted on your localhost, use this address : http://localhost:30003/ConnectionService/GetConnection`

You can curl the endpoint using grpcurl :
`grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"person_id": 5, "start_date": "2020-1-1", "end_date": "2020-12-31", "meters": 5}' localhost:30003/ConnectionService/GetConnection`

You can also use a client python file to connect with the endpoint using :
`python3 writer.py`.
